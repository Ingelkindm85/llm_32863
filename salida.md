The blue hue in the sky represents the amount of blue light that has been absorbed and reflected back to the earth. The specific ratio between absorption and reflection may vary depending on the atmospheric conditions. However, it is generally believed that the blue color of the sky reflects the presence of more blue-colored molecules (such as water droplets) in the atmosphere than the surrounding colors (such as red, orange, and yellow).","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,2927,338,8581,491,278,6575,15570,29879,29425,278,11563,29915,29879,25005,29892,607,17977,5824,7254,3578,29889,450,7254,22888,29872,297,278,14744,11524,278,5253,310,7254,3578,393,756,1063,17977,2580,322,25312,1250,304,278,8437,29889,450,2702,11959,1546,17977,683,322,17842,1122,13100,8679,373,278,15489,8096,293,5855,29889,2398,29892,372,338,6892,13112,393,278,7254,2927,310,278,14744,9432,29879,278,10122,310,901,7254,29899,2780,287,13206,21337,313,14565,408,4094,5768,10376,29897,297,278,25005,1135,278,18830,11955,313,14565,408,2654,29892,21481,865,29872,29892,322,8007,645,340,467],"total_duration":9037478972,"load_duration":7503570,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":16105000,"eval_count":118,"eval_duration":8968109000}
